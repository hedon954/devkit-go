Here's a brief overview of some common cache eviction policies:

1. FIFO (First-In-First-Out):

   - Evicts the oldest item in the cache, regardless of how frequently it's been accessed.
   - Simple to implement but doesn't consider usage patterns.

2. LFU (Least Frequently Used):

   - Evicts the item that has been accessed the least number of times.
   - Good for keeping frequently accessed items but can retain old, rarely used items.

3. MRU (Most Recently Used):

   - Opposite of LRU, evicts the most recently used item.
   - Useful in scenarios where older items are more likely to be accessed.

4. Random Replacement:

   - Randomly selects an item to evict.
   - Simple to implement and can perform surprisingly well in some scenarios.

5. ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache):

   - Combines recency and frequency to make eviction decisions.
   - Self-tuning, balancing between LRU and LFU policies.

6. CLOCK:

   - Approximates LRU without the need for moving items within a list.
   - Uses a circular buffer and a "clock hand" for eviction.

7. LIRS (Low Inter-reference Recency Set):

   - Considers the reuse distance of cache items.
   - Can outperform LRU in many scenarios.

8. 2Q (Two Queue):

   - Uses two queues to capture both recency and frequency of access.
   - Can offer better performance than LRU in some cases.

9. SLRU (Segmented LRU):

   - Divides the cache into multiple segments, each managed with LRU.
   - Allows for different treatment of items based on access patterns.

10. Time-based expiration:
    - Evicts items based on how long they've been in the cache, regardless of usage.
    - Useful for caches where data freshness is critical.
